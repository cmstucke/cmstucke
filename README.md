A little bit about me!

Number of times a day I think about the Roman Empire ðŸ¤ª:

I donâ€™t, but I marvel at the history of the Roman Republic. Rome didnâ€™t begin as the power- and resource-hungry behemoth that fills the setting for so many Hollywood epics, and the entire Mediterranean didnâ€™t suddenly wake up under Italian domination at the turn of the first millennium. Instead, the story preceding these circumstances is maybe the finest western example of a nation-stateâ€™s fall from grace relative to their own institutional values, beginning as a fledgling representative democracy with a few decent ideas about leadership and public equity, but ultimately propelled by warlike behavior to geopolitical hegemony over a block of states that it was not prepared to lead in good faith.

When I think about intrigue and drama in the ancient world, Iâ€™m less interested in imperial cohorts slowly but surely stamping out tribal resistance and fringe states that could not hope to match Romeâ€™s resources. Iâ€™m instead fascinated by the Republic's continuous choice to sustain its morbidly gargantuan, near-science fiction scales of conflict with their Phoenician, Greek, Celtic, and Germanic neighbors. Instead of a generation-defining monarch (or four) every couple of decades, the previously powerful senate set an ensemble stage of philosophers, attorneys, military leaders, and revolutionaries that would butt heads in contests of ideas and celebrity with every election cycle. Perhaps even more pertinently than its successor, the republic was also a demonstration of how the human costs of oligarchy, slavery, and settler colonialism erode the foundations of any democratic institution, no matter how seemingly permanent.

The subject of ancient Rome, in all its iterations, routinely finds itself at the heart of modern eurocentrism and mistaken supremacy. By winding the clock of context back just a few hundred years or so, present-day dads of TikTok may come to understand Imperial Rome more authentically relative to the scholarly and archeological records available to the modern world - not as a testament to Republican Romeâ€™s mightiest achievements, but as a consequence of their most grievous mistakes.
