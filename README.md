I have a design background and have endeavored to stay creative in my professional roles since school. At first exploring opportunities of a few different genres, I noticed some of the most enthusiastic and creative people in my life began to thrive in tech roles, so I became interested and began to pursue it myself.

Earlier in 2023 I was accepted into and have just recently completed App Academyâ€™s full-stack software development course. Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to gain quite a few experiences in a short amount of time: I structured a database and backend routes in Javascript using Sequelize and mapping to an Express framework, I collaborated in a team of developers to create a messaging app employing websockets and cloud storage, and Iâ€™ve emulated an ecommerce experience with React components to allow a user to create a shop feature and populate it with products.

Iâ€™m thrilled to begin searching for my next role, where I hope I can not only exercise the skills Iâ€™ve gained, but also continue a path of creativity in critical thinking, and play a small part making the products and services we all depend on more people-friendly.
